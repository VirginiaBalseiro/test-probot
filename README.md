## User Steps

Each user will have to go through the following steps in order to complete their welcome journey successfully:

1 - Add a comment to the issue with the title "How to start collaborating? Start here!". 

2 - You will get an invitation to become a collaborator. Please accept it in order to continue with the remaining steps.

3 - Now that you're a collaborator, fork the repo. You do that by clicking the __Fork__ button in the upper right corner.

4 - A issue with the title "Welcome (Your name)" will be created and assigned to you. You can either follow the link in your e-mail confirmation or look for the issue by going to the original repo (not your fork, but the repo where you started off) and clicking the Issues tab. There you can filter by Assignee -> Your name.

5 - In this issue you will find instructions with the tasks you need to complete. __Have fun!__
